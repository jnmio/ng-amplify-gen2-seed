# Amplify Build Specification (amplify.yml)
# This file defines the build and deployment steps for your AWS Amplify app.
# It is split into backend and frontend phases, with commands for installing dependencies, building, and deploying.

backend:
  phases:
    build:
      commands:
        - nvm install 20.19.4  
    # Install and use the required Node.js version for the build environment
        - nvm use 20.19.4
        - npm cache clean --force
    # Clean npm cache to avoid stale dependencies
        - npm ci --no-audit --fund false
    # Install parcel watcher (remove if not needed for your backend)
        - npx ampx pipeline-deploy --branch $AWS_BRANCH --app-id $AWS_APP_ID
    # Install dependencies using npm ci (prefer offline cache, fallback to clean install if needed)
frontend:
    # Deploy backend resources using Amplify Gen2 pipeline
  phases:
    preBuild:
      commands:
